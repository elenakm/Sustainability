# Sustainability
Project for coding

This is our final project for the CodeforGirls 8 week course. 

Our group has decided to create a informative website that explores the ways in which individuals 
can make smarter decisions in their everyday lives to make important aspect of their lives more sustainable.
The sections that we've considered are Food, Sustainability, Fashion, Fitness, and Energy.
