<div><h1>Reducing your environmental footprint whilst getting your workout on</h1>
    </div>
  <div>
    <h2>Getting there</h2> If you usually drive or take public transport to your gym, incorporate getting there into your workout as a warm-up and opt for walking or cycling there. Bad weather? Imagine training for a Tough Mudder!
  </div>
  <div>
    <h2>Apparel</h2> The apparel industry is particularly unsustainable, especially with fast fashion all around us. It’s tempting to buy into the latest trends but next time you go shopping for workout outfits, try choosing brands that have shown they care not only about their bottom line but also the environment. Look out for clothes made from recycled materials which could be anything from second hand apparel to textiles made from recycled plastic and coffee grounds. Another thing to consider is where were the products produced and if the company provides good working conditions and fair pay to their employees.
    Some sustainable brands you could try:</div>
    <div>
      <ul>
        <li> <a href="https://www.sundried.com/"target="_blank">Sundried</a> make activewear from recycled materials in European factories.
        </li>
        <li> <a href="https://www.vyayama.com/pages/responsible-fashion"target="_blank">Vyayama</a> pride themselves in offering fair working conditions and clean production facilities with minimal transportation of raw materials and no harmful chemicals in their fabrics.
        </li>
        <li> <a href="https://www.patagonia.com"target="_blank">Patagonia</a> have been leading the way in sustainable activewear (and business) since the seventies. 10% of the company’s profits go to environmental groups.
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://uk.organicbasics.com/collections/womens-theme-activewear"target="_blank">Organic Basics</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Everything reusable</h2> Take a close look at your gym bag and aim to swap out all disposable items for reusable ones. Do you buy a bottle of water/protein shake/green juice every time you work out? Bring your own reusable water bottle or shaker (hint: a good shaker bottle doubles up as a water bottle). How about your post-workout skincare? Do you use face wipes that go straight to the bin after a single use? You can find a variety of reusable options <a href="https://www.cheekywipes.com/cloth-baby-wipes.html"target="_blank">here</a> . If you go swimming or bring your own towel to the gym, you most likely need a waterproof pouch to put these in so your gym bag doesn’t get flooded. Instead of using the disposable plastic bags provided by most gyms, opt for a reusable option (you could use leak proof zip lock bags). Before stocking up on brand new reusable items, look around at home for stuff you already have that you could use. After all, sustainability is about limiting unnecessary consumption more than anything else

      <h2>Go natural</h2> You could kill two birds with one stone here (only metaphorically!) – save energy and money whilst getting your daily dose of vitamin D by choosing to move outside instead of going to the gym. Ditch the treadmill on most days and discover the benefits of jogging outside, ideally in a park or by the beach. You can even get your strength workouts done outside using your own body weight (try calisthenics or bodyweight circuits). Working out outside not only saves electricity used by gym machines, but it also makes you more in tune with your environment and gives you a more ‘natural’ experience all around. You will find yourself more challenged when running on the uneven surfaces outside and will get used to moving in different weather conditions. Your surroundings could also provide therapeutic effects comparable to a day in the spa – birdsongs, beautiful views, the scent of pine or flowers in bloom… who needs the gym?!?
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Snacks</h2> Prep your pre- and post-workout snacks in advance to save money and ensure you’re filling up on healthy and ethically sourced fruit, veg and nuts instead of going for sugar-filled snacks packaged in plastic. If you enjoy getting creative in the kitchen you could make your own healthy planet-friendly snacks like <a href="https://beamingbaker.com/5-ingredient-homemade-kind-nut-bars-vegan-gluten-free-dairy-free-refined-sugar-free/" target="_blank">these fruit and nut bars</a> or <a href="https://lovingitvegan.com/vegan-energy-balls/" target="_blank">these energy balls</a>. Are you a protein shake fan? Go with plant-based natural protein powders – their environmental footprint is smaller as production uses less water and land compared to animal protein.
