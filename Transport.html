<li> Flying 'Sustainably' is Possible: Choosing to fly is not clean and therefore, it is better to not use it. However, in cases when you want and have to fly, there are ways to fly more 'sustainably'. This is done by taking direct flights When you opt for connecting flights, you have to fly a greater distance. This results in more carbon emissions. Furthermore, choose an airline that is least polluting. For example, KLM relies on biofuels for certain routes, such as the Amsterdam-Los Angeles route. KLM and All Nippon Airway are both in the top 3 of the Dow Jones Sustainability Index. This means that, relatively speaking, they are the least polluting airlines.</li>
